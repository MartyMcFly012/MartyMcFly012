## About me
I'm a software engineer based in Iowa and Arizona. My journey into coding started back in high school when I took my first programming class. I didn't really like it back then because I thought I wouldn't be good at it. But when I entered my second year in college, a friend encouraged me to give it another go and since then, I've been hooked on finding elegant solutions to real-world problems and building cool projects.

- 🎵 Music: I love listening to various genres of music, and I also enjoy making my own tunes. You might find some of my music-related projects here on GitHub!
- 🛹 Skateboarding: When I'm not coding, you can often find me at the skatepark practicing new tricks and having fun.
- 🎥 Watching Movies: I'm a movie buff and enjoy exploring different genres and filmmakers.
